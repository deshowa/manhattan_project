#Summary of Meaningful Patterns in the Dataset#

Once we changed the sales variables to account for bad data and filtered for actual sales of 1-, 2-, nd 3- family homes, we were able to see some trends in the data.

In Display 6.0, we had applied all of these filters, but a plot of gross square feet versus sales price revealed that the data was heavily concentrated.

Therefore, we took the log of the same data in Display 7.0.  We see that the data appears to not have a strong log form, but tend to move in a positive diration aside from outliers.

We next filtered for just 1-3 family homes in Display 8.0 and received a much more centered looking dataset.  We can see that the variances across square footage have now become very constant and the trend looks somewhat linear.
The only troubling item in the graph now is the outliers below 5 on the y-axis

After deeper investigation, these items appear to not be actual sales.  We then filtered these outliers from the dataset.

Display 9.0 shows the final product.  You will see that the axes are truncated, but the overall trend does seems to be slightly positive but highly dispersed.


In Display 10.0, we zoomed out a little bit and noticed that the trend does not appear to be consistent for the trimmed down dataset.  There are probably other factors that we would need
to consider when looking at the prices of homes to build any kind of reliable forecast for pricing.  

Even when looking at the data on a Dollar/squarefoot versus total square feet basis, there is no discernable trend.
